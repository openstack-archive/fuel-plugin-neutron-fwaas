===============================================
Fuel plugin for FWaaS functionality in  Neutron
===============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/support-fwaas-in-mos

FWaaS (FireWall-as-a-Service) is Neutron extension that introduces firewall
feature set.
Neutron FwaaS  provides a cloud-centric abstractions for a security feature
set spanning traditional L2/L3 firewalls to richer application-aware
next-generation firewalls.
This plugin uses IPTables driver.

Problem description
===================

FWaaS is a very popular and useful feature, which controls the incoming and
outgoing network traffic based on an applied rule set. A firewall establishes
a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another network
(e.g., the Internet) that is assumed not to be secure and trusted. Today
it is a neccesary functionality for the using OpenStack in production.

Proposed change
===============

Implement FUEL plugin which will configure FWaaS functionality in Neutron
and Horizon.

Alternatives
------------

It also might be implemented as a part of FUEL core, but we decided to make
it as a plugin for several reasons:
* Community decided to separate FWaaS and other aaS services into their own
  project(repo), so we would do it the same way.
* Another reason is that any new additional functionality makes a project and
  testing more difficult, which is an additional risk for the FUEL release.
